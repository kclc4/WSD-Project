   <h2>About</h2>
   
   
   <p>The VTX series began in 2002 with the larger version being the VTX-1800.
   Honda realized the bike was too large for many riders, so they followed it
   up by the smaller VTX-1300. The VTX-1300 was a more manageable size with no
   shortage of power. It soon began to sell better than its larger version.</p>
   
   
   <p>The VTX-1300 is a liquid-cooled 1312cc V-twin engine. The engine hangs on
   mounts that are designed to absorb most of the motor's rumble. This gives
   the rider a more comfortable and enjoyable ride.</p>
