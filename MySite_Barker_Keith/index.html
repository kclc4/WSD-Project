  	<h2>Fender Stratocaster History</h2>
  
  	<p>The very first Fender Stratocaster was produced in 1954 by Leo Fender, 
  	Freddie Tavares and George Fullerton. It has remained one
  	of the most popular guitars of all time. Guitarists such as Eric Clapton, Jeff Beck,
  	Jimi Hendrix, Jack Bruce and Ginger Baker have used the Stratocaster in their careers.
  	Jimi Hendrix played a key part in marketing the Fender Stratocaster than any other person in 
  	history.</p>

  	<h2>Interesting Facts</h2>
  	
  	<p>The original 1954 model featured a one-piece maple neck with 21 frets. Inlays were 
  	black dots. The <strong>Sunburst</strong> color is one of the most popular colors and 
  	the most expensive. In 1982 a less expensive version was produced in Japan under the 
  	name <strong>Squier</strong>. Though the Fender Stratocaster has seen some changes over
  	the years, it is still widely considered one of the most popular guitars of all time.</p>
