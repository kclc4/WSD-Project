   	 <h2>About</h2>
   
   
   	 <p>The bald eagle became the National emblem in 1782 when the great seal of the United States was adopted
   	 The bald eagle was declared an endangered species in the U.S. in 1967. It was finally removed from the list
     of endangered species list on July 12, 1995, by the U.S. Fish & Wildlife, when it was reclassified from 
     <strong>"Endangered" to "Threatened."</strong></p>
   
   
     <p>The VTX-1300 is a liquid-cooled 1312cc V-twin engine. The engine hangs on
     mounts that are designed to absorb most of the motor's rumble. This gives
     the rider a more comfortable and enjoyable ride.</p>
